    <h2 id="about">About Kevin</h2>
        <p>"Describe yourself" is probably the hardest question one will ever come across, but here goes. 
            Kevin is a 22 year old guy, whose love for tech knows no boundaries. 
            Not as nerdy as one would assume, but it it's still there. </p>
          <p>  I only recently dived into the software development world, despite taking up IT at university. <//p>

    <h3>Educational Background</h3>
        <p> I studied at Anestar Bahati High School, later joining Zetech University in 2016 to study IT. I was really excited to join uni,
             not knowing the joke that tech studies is in Kenya. I studied till the last semester of my 2nd year, dropping out before the next semester.</p>
        <p>It was then that a friend mentioned Moringa school, and I can proudly say and reaffirm joining it is the best decision I've ever made. 
            I firmly believe the combined effort of Moringa School and  I will enable me become the software developer I've always wanted to be.</p>
    
    <h3>Work experience</h3>
        <p>Being fairly young, I do not have as much experience as I'd like, although I worked with the government during the NEMIS program roll out. </p>
        <p>I have made a handful of small websites, though none of them ever went live. It was purely for educational purposes.</p>
